6.1. Generate a random path through the grid
6.2. Use kriging to estimate mean, 𝜇, and standard deviation, 𝜎, of property at node conditional to any real data and previously simulated grid nodes in neighborhood 
6.3. Assign property value at grid node to value selected at random from 𝑁(𝜇,𝜎) 
(Normalize data)





Use kriging to estimate mean, 𝜇, and standard deviation, 𝜎, of property at node conditional to any real data and previously simulated grid nodes in neighborhood



Basic SGS Algorithm
For each realization 
 Generate a random path through the grid 
 For each grid node in path 
  Use kriging to estimate mean, 𝜇, and standard deviation, 𝜎, of property at node conditional to any real data and previously simulated grid nodes in neighborhood 
  Assign property value at grid node to value selected at random from 𝑁(𝜇,𝜎) 
 Next grid node 
Next realization

(Pseudo-)Random Numbers in SGS
•(Pseudo-) random number generator (RNG) used in two ways in SGS:
–To generate random paths through grid (permutation of cell indices)
–To generate random samples from Gaussian distribution at each grid node
•Starting RNG from same seed will generate same (sequence of) realization(s)
•Starting RNG from different seed will generate different (sequence of) realization(s)



SGS solves kriging equations and then sets porosity at grid point to a value selected at random from 𝑁(𝜇,𝜎)
